# efcoresetup
Entity Framework Core Setup Repository

After downloading but prior to using this code, you will need to execute 'dotnet ef database update' from the command line within the directory containing entityframeworkcoresetup.csproj. Doing so will create 'playtime.db' on your Desktop, which will contain the basic database structure. Executing the project itself will populate the database with some sample data.

I recommend https://sqliteviewer.app/ for viewing the structure or data of playtime.db.
